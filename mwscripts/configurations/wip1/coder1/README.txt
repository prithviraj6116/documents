   The output of 'sbver' in the sandbox.

 //mathworks/devel/sandbox/ppatil/_sbbackup/sbs_ppatil.coder1_backup/v1/.sbrevisions

   Listing of each file that was backed up. Lines that start with '-d' indicate
   that the file was deleted in the sandbox.  This file is deprecated for
   Perforce backups, as .p4data.json is now used by sbrestore instead of this
   file.

 //mathworks/devel/sandbox/ppatil/_sbbackup/sbs_ppatil.coder1_backup/v1/*

   All new or modified files identified the specified directories.

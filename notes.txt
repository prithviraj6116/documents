advanates of little endian: 
1. casts are noop since address of 1(char),2(short/half),4(int/float/word),8(longint/double/doubleword/size/addr) byte int would be same
2. for 8 bit systems or for big integers/big integers: addition and subtraction can be pipelined or parallelized since lsb needs to
perform addition/subtraction before msb

-fPIC vs load time relocation
static library vs shared library. 
shared library can be statically linked (-fPIC) vs dynamic linked (load time relocation)
dynamically loaded

1. non-sharable text section, ram usage increase since each exe that loads
library needs separate copy 2. text section needs writable, security 3. load time increases

can we relink shared library online?

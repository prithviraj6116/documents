advanates of little endian: 
1. casts are noop since address of 1(char),2(short/half),4(int/float/word),8(longint/double/doubleword/size/addr) byte int would be same
2. for 8 bit systems or for big integers/big integers: addition and subtraction can be pipelined or parallelized since lsb needs to
perform addition/subtraction before msb
